## Swim Good

### Live sea condition forecasting for wild swimmers.

Swim Good enables swimmers to track the live swimming forecast and view pollution alerts at their favourite beaches, log swim data points including date, location, distance and exertion, and discover suggested beaches in new areas. Developed in React Native with Expo, using a MongoDB database with Mongoose and an Express server on the back end.

## Try it out

1. First, get set up with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) & [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/) and grab a free [Stormglass.io](https://docs.stormglass.io/) API key.
2. ```git clone``` the repo.
3. ```npm install``` the dependencies in both the ```client``` and ```server``` folders.
4. Add an ```.env``` file in the ```client``` folder, and include your Stormglass API key and Expo connection.
5. Run ```node index.js``` in the server folder and ```expo start``` in the client folder.
6. Scan the QR code from your Expo app and start exploring!

## WIP

Plans for the future: 
* Access swim forecasting up to 10 days in advance.
* Connect with the wild swimming community to meet other users and share lesser-known locations.
