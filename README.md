## Swim Good

### Live sea condition forecasting for wild swimmers.

Swim Good enables swimmers to track the live swimming forecast and view pollution alerts at their favourite beaches, log swim data points including date, location, distance and exertion, and discover suggested beaches in new areas. Developed in React Native with Expo, using a MongoDB database with Mongoose and an Express server on the back end.

## Try it out

1. First, get set up with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) & [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/) and grab a free [Stormglass.io](https://docs.stormglass.io/) API key.
2. ```git clone``` the repo and add your API key to an ```.env``` file.
3. ```npm install``` the dependencies in both the ```client``` and ```server``` folders.
4. Start exploring with ```npm start``` in the server folder and ```expo start``` in the client folder!

## WIP

Plans for the future: 
* Access swim forecasting up to 10 days in advance.
* Connect with the wild swimming community to meet other users and share lesser-known locations.
